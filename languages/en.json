    "user_study_about_text": "This user study is about testing the usability and compatibility of the Web Bluetooth API. To get started, you first need to connect your smartphone to the browser via Bluetooth. Instructions on how to do this are already displayed in the browser. Once the connection has been established, all mouse and keyboard inputs that you make in the browser are transferred to your smartphone. You can therefore control and access your entire smartphone via the browser. The browser will now give you a small task to complete using the browser controls. When carrying out the task, please only use the browser to control your smartphone and do not make any entries on the smartphone itself. When completing the tasks, pay attention to the ease of use and factors such as the input delay. After completing the task, you will be asked a short survey in which you will be asked questions about your experiences during the user study. You do not have to answer every question, you can also leave questions unanswered that you do not want to answer. You are free to stop the trials whenever you feel it is appropriate. For example, if you get stuck at any point. There is also always a \"Cancel experiment\" button at the bottom right which takes you straight to the final survey. I will now leave the room. As soon as you have finished, simply leave the room. There is no time limit, so you can take as much time as you like.",
